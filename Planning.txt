Planning and Ideas:


Additions & QOL:
-Items given when winning a ranked contest for the first time (per pokemon?)
-Contest minigames
    -What from official pokemon games work well in cobblemon
        -dress up/pictures is fun but may be hard to code in with my knowledge
    -Any new mechanic ideas?
    -Spectator mode
    -held scarves should affect stats
    -maybe add pokeball seals and capsuls? should they give particle effects? Can I override vanilla particle animations? https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Sticker
    -Rounds:
        -1st: Pokemon Introduction: Includes friendship, seals, and capsules, and maybe some player choice thing. Instead of dress up (which I probably cant code) maybe have seals and capsules instead
        -2nd: Condition Evaluation: Purely stat based (1*contestStatType+E(0.5*otherStatTypes)+(0.5*sheen) for number of hearts based on chart https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Contest
        -3nd: Skill Contest: Move contest or optional Something directly against other pokemon?
-player hosted contests with prizes
-Maybe add pokeblocks from later contest games?
-Public contest rankings? Some way to display them?
-different booth skins/judges
-Feebas Evolution
-should be able to see learnable moves with contest stats from the card, if not also change learned and also see normal move effects
-Figure out how to use config files and set them up, also figure out what people would want to configure
-Format poffin flavor text better to match colors
-Save number of wins per contest type and level on the player
-Results of contest on the booth screen as well
-Berry Guide to see berry flavors
-Configs to allow berries from other mods/packs
-Add glow to poffin pot base when cooking

Bugs & Issues:
-Does the contest booth have different entities for the top and bottom?
-Can multiple contests be run at the same time (Different booths)?
-Does trading keep ribbons and stats?

Things I Need to Work on Before Releasing Newest Version:
-Each Time Checklist:
    - Do recipes work?
    - Do blocks drop?
    - Does card work?
        - with fainted, full party, empty party, status effects, out of ball or shouldered?
    - Does ball swapper work?
        -Drop held ball when changed?
        -Display usage message when same ball or no ball
    - Do things all work on servers and single player?
    - Does poffin pot cook?
        - Do ingeidients only go in their spots?
        - Does the info button work?
-Fabric:
    *-Ballswapper tooltip cuts off screen
    *-make sure things save

Next Update Plan Reminders:
- make contest screen tell current level of contest for pokemon
- fix poffin not being foul when result of berries is 0 (leppa + chesto)

For future reference:
-forge mod info is set in mods.toml in resources->META-INF & fabric is fabric.mod.json in resources
